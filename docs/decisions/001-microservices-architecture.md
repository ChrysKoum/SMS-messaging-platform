# ADR-001: Use Microservices Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to design an SMS messaging platform that can handle high volumes of messages with good separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. The platform needs to support asynchronous processing, different scaling requirements for different components, and independent deployment capabilities.

Key requirements:
- Handle SMS message validation and persistence
- Process messages asynchronously 
- Support independent scaling of components
- Enable independent development and deployment
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

## Decision
We will implement a microservices architecture with two primary services:

1. **SMS Service**: Handles API requests, validation, persistence, and message queuing
2. **Processor Service**: Handles message processing simulation and delivery callbacks

Each service will:
- Have its own clearly defined responsibility
- Be independently deployable via Docker containers
- Communicate through well-defined APIs and message queues
- Have its own configuration and lifecycle management

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled based on its specific load patterns
- **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
- **Independent Deployment**: Services can be deployed, updated, and rolled back independently
- **Clear Boundaries**: Well-defined service responsibilities and interfaces
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't directly impact others
- **Team Autonomy**: Different teams can work on different services independently
- **Testing Isolation**: Each service can be tested independently

### Negative
- **Distributed System Complexity**: Need to handle network failures, latency, and consistency
- **Operational Overhead**: More services to monitor, deploy, and maintain
- **Data Consistency Challenges**: Need to handle eventual consistency between services
- **Service Discovery**: Need mechanisms for services to find and communicate with each other
- **Debugging Complexity**: Distributed tracing and logging become more important

### Neutral
- **Initial Development Overhead**: More upfront work to set up service boundaries and communication
- **Documentation Requirements**: Need clear API documentation and service contracts
- **Monitoring Requirements**: Need comprehensive monitoring and observability stack

## Implementation Details

### Service Boundaries
- **SMS Service**: REST API, validation, persistence, Kafka producer
- **Processor Service**: Kafka consumer, processing logic, HTTP client for callbacks

### Communication Patterns
- **Synchronous**: REST API for external clients and internal callbacks
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka for message processing queue

### Data Management
- Each service manages its own data store
- Shared data is minimal and passed through message contracts
- No direct database access between services

## Alternatives Considered

### Monolithic Architecture
- **Pros**: Simpler deployment, easier debugging, no distributed system complexity
- **Cons**: Single point of failure, difficult to scale individual components, technology lock-in
- **Decision**: Rejected due to scaling and maintainability requirements

### Serverless Architecture
- **Pros**: Auto-scaling, pay-per-use, no server management
- **Cons**: Vendor lock-in, cold start latency, complex local development
- **Decision**: Considered for future iteration but not suitable for current requirements
